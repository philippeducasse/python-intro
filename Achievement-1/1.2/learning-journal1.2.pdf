Reflection Questions

1.	Imagine you’re having a conversation with a future colleague about whether to use the iPython Shell instead of Python’s default shell. What reasons would
 you give to explain the benefits of using the iPython Shell over the default one?

 The Ipython shell is more practical to use because it is more readable. It includes color coding as well as indentation. It also has syntax highlighting, code completion and other 
 tools that make it more interactive.

2.	Python has a host of different data types that allow you to store and organize information. List 4 examples of data types that Python recognizes, briefly 
define them, and indicate whether they are scalar or non-scalar.

Tuples: linear arrays that can store multiple data types, can't be modified. Non-scalar
Strings: Immutable sequence of characters wrapped in single or double quotes. Non-scalar
Lists: Multable character sequence wrapped in []. in JS, an array. non-scalar
dictionary: unordered set of items, each containing a key value pait, where each key is unique. non-scalar
		
3.	A frequent question at job interviews for Python developers is: what is the difference between lists and tuples in Python? Write down how you would respond.

List are mutable, tuples are not. 

4.	In the task for this Exercise, you decided what you thought was the most suitable data structure for storing all the information for a recipe. Now, imagine 
you’re creating a language-learning app that helps users memorize vocabulary through flashcards. Users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category 
(noun, verb, etc.) into the flashcards. They can then quiz themselves by flipping through the flashcards. Think about the necessary data types and what would be
 the most suitable data structure for this language-learning app. Between tuples, lists, and dictionaries, which would you choose? Think about their respective 
 advantages and limitations, and where flexibility might be useful if you were to continue developing the language-learning app beyond vocabulary memorization

 I would use dictionaries since each word would have different attributes with values, such as definition, category, etc. dictionaries are also mutable so the appc
 can be updated to include more functionalities.
