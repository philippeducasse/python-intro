destination = input("Where would you like to travel? : ")
    if destination == "Paris" or destination == "Yaounde" or destination == "Antarctica":
        print("Enjoy your stay in ", destination, "!")
    else:
        print("Oops, that destination is not currently available.")

Logical operators allow values to be compared to conditions, and the result of that comparison results in a boolean value, True or False. For example:

x = 6
x > 5

would output True.

Functions are defined computational operations that carry out a specific task. They can be invoked, or called repeatedly throughout the code as long as they are available within the scope. This is useful as this allows the program to run a specific task on any given values (as long as these values are valid input for the function) without having to re-write the entire steps of the function.

So far I feel like I have a growing grasp on the specificities of python, such as syntax and indentation. In addition, it is good for me to revise topics which I had visited some time ago in JS.
