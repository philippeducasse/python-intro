1.	What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

Databases are organised collections of data where information can be stored for long term. The advantage of using them is that information can be kept there safely and is not erased or only available in working memory

2.	List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

    VARCHAR: used for storing text / string based elements
    INT: used for storing numerical values
    DATE: used to store date values
	
	
	

3.	 In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?


   - While both are database management systems, they do offer different services and features. SQLite is designed for single-user
     applications where there is no need for concurrent access by multiple users. If your application is not expected to have many
     concurrent connections, SQLite can be a more straightforward solution. SQLite is easy to set up and is a great choice for
     prototyping and testing purposes. You can quickly create and manipulate a SQLite database without the need for a separate
     database server. However, MySQL offers advanced features like stored procedures, triggers, and views that are not available
     in SQLite. If you need complex database logic, MySQL is a better option. Also, MySQL offers advanced features like stored procedures,

4.	Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

There are many differences between Javasccript and Python, but they are in essence quite similar as they are dynamically typed programming languages. Python syntax is slightly less verbose and relies on indentation rather than {}. Python also has a vast library for implemented mathematical formulas, making it more appropriate for mathematical tasks, such as machine learning. Python needs to be compiled in order to be read on the browser whereas JS can be read directly, making JS more appropriate for front end applications.

5.	Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

Python is an interpreted language, and has a limited ecosystem for front-end development.
