Model adjustements: I have slightly changed the recipe model by adding a user_id attribute.
This effectively enables all created recipes to come with the id number of the 
user that created them. Also adding images for each recipe, and added the calculate difficulty function.

Inspiration from existing apps:

Wolt - I liked the color, and the organisation of the recipes.

Epicurious - I like the search bar, and the background image.

NYT cooking - I like the various displays and the side bar
