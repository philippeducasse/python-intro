1.	Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

Django has many advantages, such as ease of use, deployment speed, scalability. It provides developers with fast, reliable, and secure ways of deploying applications through its vast network of libraries and tools. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as file size, and strict file structure ("The Django way"). If I were at a company, I would probably use Django instead of vanilla Python if the project was in the medium to large scale range.

2.	In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

The main advantage of MVT architecture is that developers no longer need to write the controller code when making requests, as with MVT architecture the view interacts with the model and the template and coordinates with them to send back the appropriate response url. It is also more suitable for smaller applications.

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
●	What do you want to learn about Django? 

I want to learn in more detail how it works, how to create an app with it and how to optimise its implementaion. I would also like to know how things work under the hood.
●	What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
A fully functional and user friendly app.
●	Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
A new React app possibly using python in the backend
