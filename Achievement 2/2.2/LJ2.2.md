1.	Suppose you’re in an interview. The interviewer gives you their company’s website as an example, asking you to convert the website and its different parts into Django terms. How would you proceed? For this question, you can think about your dream company and look at their website for reference. 
(Hint: In the Exercise, you saw the example of the CareerFoundry website in the Project and Apps section.)

The overarching webpage or application is known as the project in Django. Each project is then divided into apps, and these can be re-usable accross projects. In the interview, I would describe all the different parts of the website as separate apps. For example, the login button references the login app in Django. 

2.	In your own words, describe the steps you would take to deploy a basic Django application locally on your system. 

First, I would create a new virtual environment with the specific python version i would like to implement. Second, I would install django when the virtual environment is activated. I would then create the project in the desired directory, create a superuser, and run a test server to check that everything is working correctly. 

3.	Do some research about the Django admin site and write down how you’d use it during your web application development.
The DJango admin panel allows superusers to directly perform CRUD operations on the project, saving a lot of development time as no code has to be written.
